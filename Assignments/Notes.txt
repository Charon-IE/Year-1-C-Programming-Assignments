Scanf can't be used of reading strings with spaces
Fgets, with the stdin file pointers works fine
Scanf with  %[^\n]s **Note the space before the %
***Also include a space after the printf prompt

Changed displayobj to int = Need 3 possibilites, -1 for examine,drop,pick, where display object is no longer needed for that iteration of the loop

Item Management:
Two variable array, element 0 and element 1 represent item 1 and item 2 respectively. Intially both 0, when player has the specific item (carrying it), it is changed to 1

Item Element 0 = USB Drive
Item Element 1 = Ice Cream

Upon taking an item, increment the element respective to the item and set that objects location to 0
0 will represent that its on the person


When examining items, if there are no items to examine in the area, examine the against items you are carrying, stringcompare to check exactly what item and then see if you have that item.

Inventory command, check carry array to see if youre carrying anything and inform the user. insert a comma at the second iteration and if something was printed in the previous location

Drop command, changes items location variable in the array

When displaying 2 objects in a location, formatted it properly

Added a lowercase function, to improve the user experience. commands/object names will no longer be case sensitive.
-Added a lowercase converter function
-When reading in the names for the objects, send the names to a lower case converter
-Doesnt require the user to be case sensitive
-Lowercase converter is also present when reading the input, makes comparing strings easy
-Problem: When displaying the names, the are in lowercase
-Possible Solution: Make a temp name array for object name and keep original

Solution:
2-D array to store object name strings
Use strcpy to copy name of the object into the 2-d array
Send the copy into the lower case converter
Print proper name of object ("w/ capitals") whenever the name needs to be displayed on the screen.

**Strcpy_s Parameters: (Destination, MaxSize of Source, Source)
